# Study Circle
Study Circle is a mobile app designed to help students connect with classmates and find study partners or project teammates. 

With a Tinder-style swiping system, students can quickly find and match with others in the same courses who are also looking for study groups or project teams.

The app provides a simple way for users to create a profile, select their enrolled classes, and start swiping through potential study partners. If two students swipe right on each other, they get matched and can start chatting right away!

We designed the app through Figma: https://www.figma.com/design/RulKckHuCeWSLtV4WZY7oO/Study-Circle?node-id=0-1&t=K99LmhETnm0KlrqG-1
